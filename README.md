batch:- This is my first batch file. All it does is takes input from the user and open's the webpages related to that input.
open_folder:- This python file opens the fileexplorer(windows) with whatever path we provide.                                              
matrix_addition:- This python program generates 2 random 3*3 matrices and add's them.
